Attempt to learn CSS animations, without using any javascript, and to make Emoji fly\

## Purpose
To expand my knowledge around CSS, and to create animations without the reliance of javascript. Note; Javascript is being used to change which animation is being shown without navigating to a separate page. I wanted to set a goal of some form of interactivity and variance in the animations.

## End goal.
For Emojis to go from left to right in grid patterns of different sizes on loop.\
Interactive buttons below of the siren will change the background to a red, and the emojis to the siren with meteors coming crashing down and explosions on collision.

## Realistic achievement?
Emojis moving from left to right with no major interactivity on loop should be possible.
