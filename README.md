# FlyinEmoji
CSS attempt to make Emoji fly

## Purpose
To learn a bit of CSS and how elements can be animated changed with basic javascript.

## End goal.
For Emojis to go from left to right in grid patterns of different sizes on loop.
Interactive buttons below of the siren will change the background to a red, and the emojis to the siren with meteors coming crashing down and explosions on collision.

## Realistic achievement?
Emojis moving from left to right with no major interactivity on loop should be possible.
